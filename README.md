# Super-Mario-Bros-Engine

An unfinished attempt at a proof of concept SMB1 remake. Credit goes to Toony and Sooshy for most of the (original) art and Gatete for the base engine. Gatete's SMB1 Engine does not come with a license, but we did have permission to use it.

If you want to continue this or whatever, contact me first.
